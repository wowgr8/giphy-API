## Project Title: GIPHY API Search

## API Key Procurement:
- _This application uses the GIPHY-API. You will need to make an account and get an API key if you wish to recreate the project environment on your local. The "Free Plan" allows for 2000 API calls per month.

- _Visit the [GIPHY Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/) site._

- _If you are new to GIPHY, click Log In in the top right and create a new user account. You'll be prompted to create an account with your email, first name and a password. Agree to the terms of use, click "Get Started!" and confirm your email address. Access your account dashboard that includes your API key as well as your remaining API calls for the month._

- _Click the "Create an App" button._
